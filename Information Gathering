Information Gathering

• This is the first step of any penetration testing or ethical hacking.
• It involves gathering or collection of information about an individual, company, website or system that you are targeting.


For Example:-
Any company is hired you to perform a penetration testing on their website. so, during the first phase of penetration testing, 
which information you gather?  what is your objectives?
 
Our objective is to learn more about the website on which you are performing penetration testing, means: 
• We need to identify what is web technology is being used on the website.(eg:- html, css, php, etc..)
• We need to identify any vulnerabilities that websites have.
• We need to know more about IP  Address of the server that's hosting that website.
So from that information we are getting a better understanding of the website that we are targeting.


For example you have been contracted to perform a penetration test fo a company and that have you given a scope that you can target a few pyblic facing assets like webserver & couple of internal systems within the internal netwok.
• 			And you may gain  access to the internal nwtwork through publicly facing assets like server that may be one attack vector
• 			Or alternativley during the information gathering step - we find out the employee that working for that company.

This is most important piece of information - in this context would be identify their named and their emails.
Why it's so important? Because instead of exploiting the web server in order to gain access to their internal network through pivot is easy.
We perform a phishing attack or send a malicious attachment to one of the employee cia email. That could provide access to their internal network.

 
•  The more information you have on your target, the more successful you will be during the latter stages of a penetration test.
• Information  gathering is broken down into two types:-
            1. Passive Information gathering
            2. Active information gathering

For example from passive information gathering phase, we identified the IP address of the web server.
So, in active information  gathering phase. we can start performing a port scan of on that IP address to identify the open ports 
and their respective services that are running on the ports

And we can use that information to indentify vulnerabilities that can be exploited
