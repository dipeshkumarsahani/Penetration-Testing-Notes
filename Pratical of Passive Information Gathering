Pratical of Passive Information Gathering

If you have only Domain of website then, find 
IP address of that website
• Finding IP address information:

Command tool
1. host 
┌──(dipesh㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ host google.com
google.com has address 142.250.183.78
google.com has IPv6 address 2404:6800:4007:81d::200e
google.com mail is handled by 10 smtp.google.com.

2. robots.txt
See information of robots.txt if you have domain

└─$ whois google.com                              
   Domain Name: GOOGLE.COM
   Registry Domain ID: 2138514_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

Google Dorking
search form search engine, list of google dorking  and use to find sensitive information 
We can also use goole hacking database




Netcraft 
It provides a lot of information about an website.
• Background information like:- Site tittle, site rank, Date fist seen, Primary Language on website etc.
• Network infomation like:- Domain, IP address, Name Server, TLD's information etc.
• SSL/TLS certificate information
• Certificate Transparency information
• Information regarding this site is vulnerable to any SSL/TLS related information
• Site technology information etc.
Note:- similiar information we will get like whois 


Shodan
Footprinting with shodan search engine
• Shodan is a search engine on which we can see all the devices which are connected on the internet.
• Devices means printer, refrigerators, computers, routers, modern, servers, etc. which are connected to the internet.
• It is different form search engines like Google and Bing because google and bing are great for finding websites but Sodan crawls all the devices and stores the result on its database.
• Shodan gathers information by interacting with web services and this infomation is stored in an object called the banner, so when you search and anything using a shodan dork (search query) shodan takes the information form the banner of that service and displays it to you. In simple words banner is a metadata.
• So as a penetration tester, we can use a specific shodan queries/ filters to get the information about those particular devices, which have been indexed by shodan.
It has two versions:
• Web based
• CLI based

Shodomain
It is github tool which is used to find subdomain

Certificate transparancy 
web tool crt.sh
• As s penetration tester we will use this tool to find subdomains
CLI tool  1N3/crt.sh--this is script to find subdomain and save in a file, copy script from github and save to exexute script

Censys
similar as shodan, censys is paid tool but we will get 250 quory at free login.
• To get more quory use fake email to register 

Pentest-tools.com
• we can find more information like:- subdomain, openport, etc.
• serve this tools before use it to understand this tool

virustotal
• Virustotal is used to find many information, but we use to find subdomain.

sublist3r
• A subdomain finder tool, we can download from github using git clone.
• Or we can install it by CLI sudo apt install sublist3r

chaos.projectdiscovery
https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/
• It scan the target which in bugbounty list, this porject it self scan to find which new subdomain added 
• we can download bunch of subdomains form here
CLI tool chaospy found in github
https://github.com/zorox0x/chaospy


archive.org
• wayback machine
• waybackurl github, used to download urls  from CLI of target, direct on system
